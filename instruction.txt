Use the above API to create a social media webapp.

This webapp should have 2 pages:

A list page where you can browse users
The list should show 10 users at a time
The list should be paginated, calling the API to fetch the next 10 users
Going back a page in the pagination should present the same users, not a list of new users
Each user in the list should show a thumbnail image, First and Last name, and their user name
The list should be filter-able through search
Should be able to search by first name, last name or username
A details page where you can see additional information about each user
The details page should display:
First and last name
Email
Username
Location
Street address, city and postal code
Country
Should contain a back button to go back to the list page. It should maintain the page the user was on before they visited the details page.
BONUS
Fully unit-test the application with 100% code coverage
